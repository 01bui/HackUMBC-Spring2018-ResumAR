# Inspiration
Often times, a recruiter has approximately 9 seconds to scan through a resume, and hundreds of resumes a day. We create resumAR to make this journey more enjoyable and efficient. Not only will the platform be useful for recruiter, it also creates an environment to help career search based on personal interests and skill sets, therefore, helping create economic opportunity more efficiently to everyone.

# What it does
We build a platform that helps the design of an interactive and customized resume based on augmented reality (AR) technology with an support of artificial intelligence from our developed assistant bot. Firstly, several questions based on user's job interests and skills are asked to the users. Based on the answers, the bot will response with potential positions and suggest the users to highlight certain skills or projects as AR markers for further descriptions and demonstrations.

# How we built it
We built ResumAR with different technologies e.g. Unity Vuforia, Microsoft Azure web hosting. Our website is written in HTML, CSS, JS. The assistant bot is built based on natural language processing using Microsoft Cognitive Service.

# Challenges we ran into
We spent a long time to figure out how to properly play video on AR in Unity Vuforia.

# Accomplishments that we're proud of
We successfully built our AR resume on Unity Vuforia. We also figure how to host a web app on Microsoft Azure including using Azure media service to store the background video for the website.

# What we learned
We learn to build an AR mobile phone app from scratch. We figure how to deploy the Unity project to both Android and iOS mobile phones.

# What's next for ResumAR
Further data training for the assistant bot will be employed. In addition, we want to expand our AR capability for 3D display to a more interactive user experience. improve the chat bot so that it can effectively
